I also spend a lot of my time working on\n            new music under the alias Cordio.

posts, yet here we are!\n            This definitely won’t be a dragged on post by any means, but I think landing a dream job\n            of mine constitutes a post like this.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Back when I started designing as an 18 year old, I would spend my nights researching\n            design to try to improve and find resources I could use. Early on, I came\n            across <L href=\"http://metalab.co/\">MetaLab</L> and\n            immediately fell in love with the company. As a young designer it was inspiring to see\n            the type of companies they worked with and the impact they had on the lives of people.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            MetaLab was all about making things that not only worked well, but looked beautifully\n            badass. While I was nowhere good enough or experienced to comprehend the strategy and\n            work that went into these projects, MetaLab and similar companies have been a North\n            Star in design for me since I can remember. The people, the work, the environment,\n            from the outside looking in it seemed to be too good to be true.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Fast forward to a few months ago as I was looking for new companies to call home. A\n            friend of mine (shout out to <L href=\"https://twitter.com/Jabronus\">Noah</L>!) mentioned\n            the company he worked for (MetaLab) was hiring remote employees. At first I thought\n            there was no way I’d get a job like that, I felt I wasn’t good enough. I thought about\n            it for a little and ended up submitting my resume anyways, couldn’t hurt right?\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            During the interview process I found something I hadn’t found in other “larger” companies\n            I had applied and interviewed for. The people. From the people I interviewed with to friends\n            I knew at the company, the same constant remained of the culture and people being the reason\n            they joined and stayed at the company. I saw that MetaLab nurtured a genuine culture that\n            cared about employees. Choosing your own hours for what suits your lifestyle best, encouraging\n            you to travel and take time off, helping cover your fitness fees so you can stay healthy, etc.\n            Overall MetaLab wants you to have the freedom you would have if you worked for yourself without\n            having to worry about the business side of things that come with that. I couldn't imagine a better\n            fit for what I was looking for.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A couple months later after 3 interviews and a test project, I received a call with an offer\n            to join MetaLab as a Product Designer. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. As I’m writing this it\n            still hasn’t really settled in and all feels surreal to me. To be 23 years old and have landed\n            a dream job of mine feels incredible. Seeing the years of hard work I invested into my passion\n            come to fruition in a way like this is indescribable.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I’ll be working remote from Memphis, TN for the time being. I can’t wait to see the difficult\n            challenges I’ll be designing for and the impact I’ll help MetaLab make while I’m there. I’ll\n            be heading to their HQ in Canada for my onboarding week and cannot wait to meet some of my\n            teammates. I’ve never been to Canada, so let me know of some cool places in Vancouver I should see!\n          </p>\n        </NewsLayout>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default iAmJoiningMetaLab;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Pages/News/NewsPosts/020718/index.jsx","import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nimport L from '../../L';\nimport NewsLayout from '../../NewsLayout';\n\nclass myFirstEPIsAvailable extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"bg-black-blue\">\n        <NewsLayout\n          title=\"My First EP HM-01 is Available Now\"\n          subtitle=\"My first of many releases in my musical creation hobby\"\n          date=\"Mar 1st, 2018\"\n          url=\"my-first-ep-is-available\"\n          twitterLink=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=My%20First%20EP%20HM-01%20is%20Available%20Now%20by%20%40fromcortes%20http%3A//cortes.us/news/my-first-ep-is-available\"\n          facebookLink=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A//cortes.us/news/my-first-ep-is-available\"\n          googleLink=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A//cortes.us/news/my-first-ep-is-available\"\n        >\n          <p>\n            If you told me I'd have an EP finished and up on all streaming platforms last year\n            I'd think you're crazy. I know it's not an uncommon thing to have happen, but it's\n            very surreal to my high school self who dreamt day and night of making music.

HM-01 is great for studying, working, or chilling out to if that's what\n            you're looking for. I have some more music already in the works and just recently bought an <L href=\"https://teenageengineering.com/products/op-1\">OP-1</L> to\n            really put me in a great spot fo make music a main hobby for myself outside of my design and development work.\n            I can't wait to share even more music with you, but I hope you'll love HM-01 as much as I did making it for now.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I put quite a bit of work into creating this EP from start to finish and would love if\n            you took some time to listen to it, share it with your friends, and let me know what\n            you think about it.

However, HM-01 is the first public trace of his musical talents. His music incorporates dreamy ambient with hip-hop, jazz, and classical for a unique sound. Following HM-01, HM-02 explores a more emotional side to Cordio’s craft. The music is all centered around a common theme, he says, but he leaves it up to listeners to interpret that theme how they wish. Wood percussion melodies wind around melancholic, analog-sounding synths on opener 'Gem Mint.' The record then takes a jazzier turn, stumbling through woozy beats and sad melodies towards the static-laced, wonky ambient closer 'Carrier Decay.'\"\n            </em>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Feel free to read the full post and other artists featured <L href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/05/23/best-new-ambient-may-2018/\">here</L>.\n          </p>\n        </NewsLayout>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default featuredInBestAmbientMusicOnBandcamp;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Pages/News/NewsPosts/061518/index.jsx","import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nimport L from '../../L';\nimport NewsLayout from '../../NewsLayout';\n\nclass HM03IsOutEverywhereNow extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"bg-black-blue\">\n        <NewsLayout\n          title=\"HM-03 is Out Everywhere Now\"\n          subtitle=\"The third installation of my EP series is ready for ya\"\n          date=\"Jul 5th, 2018\"\n          url=\"hm-03-is-out-everywhere-now\"\n          twitterLink=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=HM-03%20is%20Out%20Out%20Everywhere%20Now%20by%20%40fromcortes%20http%3A//cortes.us/news/hm-03-is-out-everywhere-now\"\n          facebookLink=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A//cortes.us/news/hm-03-is-out-everywhere-now\"\n          googleLink=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A//cortes.us/news/hm-03-is-out-everywhere-now\"\n        >\n          <p>\n            Very proud and excited to announce that my 3rd EP is now finished and available for you\n            to <L href=\"/music\">stream anywhere</L> you listen to music!

Learning to accept and and thrive in what seems like solitude is how we cope, and\n            we \"ride the waves\" of these emotions to the best of our abilities. While there are other\n            overarching themes and smaller ones as well, I'd like to leave the rest up to your\n            interpretation. Listen for mellow melodies paired with hard-hitting kicks and snares sprinkled\n            with unique but familiar extras. Try and find all the themes on this medium-sized EP.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I'm very excited for you to hear this EP as it's my favorite so far in terms of messaging\n            and style. I'd call the style very much \"Ambient Hip-Hop\" and am quite content with how\n            my musical style is developing. I still have a ton to learn, which is exciting for me as\n            someone passionate towards music production, music culture, and bringing other passions\n            and perspectives from my life into my work.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I plan to make 9 EPs before my first full-fledged album and will be starting on HM-04 before\n            you know it.
