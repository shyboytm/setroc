Rico.\n            I grew up mainly in Plantation, FL and studied design in college after putting my rap producer dreams to rest.\n            I love working day-to-day on projects that require multidisciplinary skill sets solving complex issues that make the lives of people better.\n            I make a lot of products on my own outside of my full-time work on a team.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"lh-copy\">\n            I enjoy thinking about experience based solutions through use of design and technological implications.\n            I find internal systematic struggles intriguing and set to solve and improve processes to better the way\n            people work and interact with technology. Through merging expertise in product, branding,\n            illustration, and web technologies, I can better approach problems for modern overarching solutions.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"lh-copy\">\n            Outside of design, I write and release at least one article a week (70+ weeks!) and spend time\n            coding for the web to build projects to benefit myself and others. I love spending time with my dogs,\n            playing video games, making music, and eating food. As a firm believer in helping others, most of my efforts\n            go towards finding ways to work with people and bringing value to their life and ventures.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"lh-copy\">\n            I'm always open to chat!

old digital designer and illustrator that codes based in Memphis, TN from Bayamón, Puerto Rico.\n            I grew up mainly in Plantation, FL and studied design in college after putting my rap producer dreams to rest.\n            I love working day-to-day on projects that require multidisciplinary skill sets solving complex issues that make the lives of people better.\n            I make a

design and technological implications.\n            I find internal systematic struggles intriguing and set to solve and improve processes to better the way\n            people work and interact with technology. Through merging expertise in product, branding,\n            illustration, and web technologies, I can better approach problems for modern overarching solutions.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"lh-copy\">\n            Outside of design, I write and release at least one article a week (70+ weeks!) and spend time\n            coding for the web to build projects to benefit myself and others. I love spending time with my dogs,\n            playing video games, making music, and eating food. As a firm believer in helping others, most of my efforts\n            go towards finding ways to work with people and bringing value to their life and ventures.\n          </p>\n\n          <Spacer />\n\n          <Title\n            title=\"Games I'm Playing\"\n            toolTipText=\"🎮\">\n          </Title>\n          <div className=\"db\">\n            <p className=\"fw4 lh-copy\">\n              My current lineup of single-player games I am playing through.\n            </p>\n            <Feature\n              href=\"http://amzn.to/2EJUrhY\"\n              name=\"Night in the Woods\" />\n            <Feature\n              href=\"http://amzn.to/2zOSvSQ\"\n              name=\"Super Mario Odyssey\" />\n            <Feature\n              href=\"http://amzn.to/2Di0X2d\"\n              name=\"Assassin's Creed: Origins\" />\n            <Feature\n              href=\"http://amzn.to/2D7mTK7\"\n              name=\"Pokémon Gold\" />\n            <Feature\n              href=\"http://amzn.to/2ypBctD\"\n              name=\"Stardew Valley\" />\n            <Feature\n              href=\"http://amzn.to/2D3hHXP\"\n              name=\"Pokémon Ultra Moon\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"flex flex-column w-25-l pv4-l ph4-l pa5-m pa4 br b--black-10\">\n          <Currently />\n\n          <Spacer />\n\n          <Title\n            title=\"Approach\"\n            toolTipText=\"❤️\">\n          </Title>\n          <div className=\"fw4 lh-copy\">\n            <p className=\"lh-copy measure mb4\">\n              I believe all work is more than just technique.

posts, yet here we are!\n            This definitely won’t be a dragged on post by any means, but I think landing a dream job\n            of mine constitutes a post like this.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Back when I started designing as an 18 year old, I would spend my nights researching\n            design to try to improve and find resources I could use. Early on, I came\n            across <L href=\"http://metalab.co/\">MetaLab</L> and\n            immediately fell in love with the company. As a young designer it was inspiring to see\n            the type of companies they worked with and the impact they had on the lives of people.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            MetaLab was all about making things that not only worked well, but looked beautifully\n            badass. While I was nowhere good enough or experienced to comprehend the strategy and\n            work that went into these projects, MetaLab and similar companies have been a North\n            Star in design for me since I can remember. The people, the work, the environment,\n            from the outside looking in it seemed to be too good to be true.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Fast forward to a few months ago as I was looking for new companies to call home. A\n            friend of mine (shout out to <L href=\"https://twitter.com/Jabronus\">Noah</L>!) mentioned\n            the company he worked for (MetaLab) was hiring remote employees. At first I thought\n            there was no way I’d get a job like that, I felt I wasn’t good enough. I thought about\n            it for a little and ended up submitting my resume anyways, couldn’t hurt right?\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            During the interview process I found something I hadn’t found in other “larger” companies\n            I had applied and interviewed for. The people. From the people I interviewed with to friends\n            I knew at the company, the same constant remained of the culture and people being the reason\n            they joined and stayed at the company. I saw that MetaLab nurtured a genuine culture that\n            cared about employees. Choosing your own hours for what suits your lifestyle best, encouraging\n            you to travel and take time off, helping cover your fitness fees so you can stay healthy, etc.\n            Overall MetaLab wants you to have the freedom you would have if you worked for yourself without\n            having to worry about the business side of things that come with that. I couldn't imagine a better\n            fit for what I was looking for.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A couple months later after 3 interviews and a test project, I received a call with an offer\n            to join MetaLab as a Product Designer. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. As I’m writing this it\n            still hasn’t really settled in and all feels surreal to me. To be 23 years old and have landed\n            a dream job of mine feels incredible. Seeing the years of hard work I invested into my passion\n            come to fruition in a way like this is indescribable.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I’ll be working remote from Memphis, TN for the time being. I can’t wait to see the difficult\n            challenges I’ll be designing for and the impact I’ll help MetaLab make while I’m there. I’ll\n            be heading to their HQ in Canada for my onboarding week and cannot wait to meet some of my\n            teammates. I’ve never been to Canada, so let me know of some cool places in Vancouver I should see!\n          </p>\n        </NewsLayout>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default iAmJoiningMetaLab;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Pages/News/NewsPosts/020718/index.jsx","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router';\nimport { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';\n\nimport NewsItem from './NewsItem';\nimport Title from '../../Title';\n\nimport Footer from '../../Footer';\n\nclass News extends Component {\n  render() {\n\n    const pageName = \"News\";\n    const pageDescription = \"I think it's hard to remember and give ourselves credit for our achievements.
